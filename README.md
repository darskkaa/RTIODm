## Information

*This is the official Repository of the RTIOD - Robust Thermal-Image Object Detection Challenge at WACV 2026 (RTIOD@WACV2026)*

Ready to stress-test your detector in the wild? The 6th Real World Surveillance Workshop at WACV 2026 [RWS@WACV2026](https://vap.aau.dk/rws/) introduces a new challenge on Robust Thermal-Image Object Detection using the LTDv2 dataset to advance multi-object detection performance under long-term thermal drift. Real-world thermal imaging is messy: sensors re-calibrate, ambient temperatures swing, and weather keeps changing, which slowly erode detector performance.

The objectives, rules, and challenge submission are handled on the Codabench challenge [page](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/10954/).

Challenge dataset: **LTDv2** [paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.175339329.95323969) [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vapaau/LTDv2)

A starting kit to run some baseline experiments with YOLO is available [here](https://github.com/MarcoParola/RTIOD/tree/main/starting_kit), but feel free to reimplement from scratch all the code ;) In that case, we also release the [torch dataset](./starting_kit/src/datasets/dataset.py) to manage the dataset in the original COCO format along with some [configuration](./starting_kit/config/config.yaml), and [utility functions](./starting_kit/src/utils/).
